### 🌎🛰️🧊 Ahoy!
> - My name is Brad, and I am a physical research scientist and NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.
> - My research focuses on gaining a better underatanding of the permafrost carbon feeeback and cryospheric earth system dynamics by capturing the ecological memory of a rapidly changing landscape with in situ, remote sensing, process-basd modeling, and AI. The underpinning goal is to disentangle the causal links and feedback drivers of change attributed to the dynamics of the permafrost carbob continuum with feedback neural networks).
> - More holistically, my work seeks to bridge the gap between physical scientists and systems engineers with data-driven approaches to better inform synthesis, analysis, and discovery.
> - Collaboration opportunities and research inquiries are always welcome!
