Hello, world. 

PhD Student, George Mason University
ABoVE SIBBORK-TTE Permafrost Modeling, NASA-GSFC | MSR EEV UTTR SMAP Analysis, NASA-LARC |  ISE Remote Sensing and Ground Cover Research Fellow, Future Earth

My research focuses on earth systems in the cryosphere and drivers of change in Alaska; more specifically, these efforts seek to disentangle the causal links and feedback drivers of change attributed to permafrost carbon dynamics with earth observation data, gap modeling, feedback networks, and ecological memory.
