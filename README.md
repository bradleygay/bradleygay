#### Hello, world. ðŸ‘‹

> - My name is Brad, and I am an arctic research scientist and PhD Candidate at George Mason University.
> - My research focuses on earth systems in the cryosphere and drivers of change in Alaska; more specifically, disentangling the causal links and feedback drivers of change attributed to permafrost carbon dynamics with earth observation data, modeling, feedback neural networks, and ecological memory.
