#### Hello, world. 👋

> - My name is Brad, and I am a PhD Student at George Mason University, a polar research scientist at NASA, and a graduate research fellow at Future Earth.
> - My research focuses on earth systems in the cryosphere and drivers of change in Alaska; more specifically, disentangling the causal links and feedback drivers of change attributed to permafrost carbon dynamics with earth observation data, gap modeling, feedback networks, and ecological memory.
